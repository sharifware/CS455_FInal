Your repository should provide a read me with clear instructions on how to compile and execute your work.
Build files such as makefiles, gradle files, script, etc.. are appreciated when applicable.
It must also provide clear instructions on any required resources and instructions (or links to instructions) to install those resources.

Be sure to cite within your comments any use of external code regardless of the source's license.

Note: Use of 3rd party developed source code (including code snippets borrowed from Stack Overflow) are properly cited in the code with a comment and/or other appropriate documentation as per the source's license.
